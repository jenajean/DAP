				<h2>COMPLETE PIANO SERVICE</h2>
				<p>
					This is the foundation and mainstay of David Andersen Pianos; we offer what we call
					complete piano service to pianos in the Los Angeles area. Once a piano is brought to a
					high level of performance through rounds of tuning, action regulation and tone building
					(which includes voicing) it requires relatively little maintenance to keep it at the same
					high level of function year after year.  Naturally, the amount of maintenance needed
					varies with the amount and intensity of usage.

					<h3>Definition</h3>
					<br />
					<p>
						The ability to understand, diagnose, and implement the work
						necessary to put a piano in its maximum playing condition, and keep it
						there, through judicious maintenance, throughout its years of use.
					</p>
					<h3>Maintenance</h3> 
					<p>
						Tuning is the basis of what we do.  My tuning system,
						whole-tone, open-string tuning, is what virtually every concert tuner
						used until the advent of electronic tuning devices---"old school."  A
						good solid, stable, musical tuning will maximize the beauty of the
						piano, and can radically change the player's perception of the piano's
						touch and tone. I get a big charge, still, from throwing a great
						tuning on a good piano; an even greater thrill is hearing my work
						recorded; I'm fascinated by how good it sounds and frustrated that
						it's not perfect---I'm my own harshest critic. If you want to know
						more about my tuning system, click here.

					<h3>Action Performance Enhancement</h3>
					<p>
						Many piano actions greatly benefit from weight redistribution,
						geometric changes (changes in position of the levers involved in
						getting the hammer to the string,) weight addition or reduction,
						parts repositioning, or a combination of the above coupled with
						precise action regulation. If you recently purchased a new grand
						piano, and the action feels stiff, sluggish, or bound somehow,
						Your piano may be a candidate for this work. <br />

						We've done this kind of custom action tweaking for years, to
						dozens of piano actions, and our results are very consistent and
						repeatable.  Piano work is not voodoo; it's engineering, science
						and intuitive craft together.  The old myths that a piano "feels
						like it feels" or that its touch, its feel, will fundamentally
						change once you "break it in" are, now, just pernicious old
						myths---now, we can focus the touch, the spielart of an action in
						a very precise way, so that a player can, in effect, "dial in," by
						means of communication and work with us, just what he or she wants
						in terms of lightness or heaviness of touch, amount of resistance,
						and ease of repetition.  We use the Stanwood protocols for
						evaluating the function of an action, which is based on measuring
						weight---which is what a pianist feels---rather than distance. We
						have found this to be an exponential improvement in the control we
						have over how an action feels. <br /> If you go to a piano seller
						and play a rebuilt Steinway, it should feel light but not too
						light---and resistant, but not too resistant: substantial, fast
						and responsive, right then, to your fingers.  If it doesn't,
						there's a good chance the work is "B" or  "C" quality, as opposed
						to the "A+" quality of a custom restoration. One revealing
						strategy is to ask the seller for a complete list of the parts and
						protocols used to restore the instrument, and see what the
						reaction is.

					<h3>Action Regulation</h3>
					<p>
						Action regulation is dealing with the mechanism---the keys,
						keyframe and parts stack, collectively called the action, along with
						and aided by the damper/pedal system, or "back action"---that
						transfers energy from the player's fingers to the point where the
						hammer strikes the strings. There are many points in each individual
						key mechanism (all 88) that can be adjusted and by so doing, bring
						each key mechanism into the parameters and specifications that the
						manufacturer intended.  Because a piano action is mostly comprised of
						parts made of wood, leather, and felt, these materials can wear,
						shrink or swell easily, and need to be attended to.  A piano is a very
						forgiving machine---it can function, play notes and repeat, even if
						it's almost mortally compromised---but it's so much more fulfilling
						and inspiring to play an instrument that's been well-regulated and is
						functioning at nearly 100% capacity. <br />
						It's usually not because of your fingers, or advancing age, or
						anything to do with you that the piano seems harder, or spongier, or
						not as much fun to play as it used to be:  it's usually simply a lack
						of mechanical regulation, which is easy to fix.

					<h3>Voicing</h3>
					<p>
						This is the Dark Continent, or the "final frontier," of piano
						technology. Very few piano technicians venture deep into the world
						of building tone in a piano hammer. People usually think of
						voicing as sticking needles into the hammers; this is a part of
						voicing/tone building, but many other protocols need to be done
						and in place before my needles come out:  the action needs to be
						well and precisely regulated, the strings need to be seated,
						"lifted," and leveled, the hammers need to be filed to the proper
						shape and mated with the leveled strings, and the tuning needs to
						be stable, precise, and musical.
						<br />
						Then, and only then, there are specific needling methods and
						locations for different brands and types of hammers that an
						experienced voicing tech can use to even out the attack of each
						note, make the tone sound fatter, and regulate the volume level at
						which the hammer produces an edgier, more "attack-y" tone. Other
						tools used for hammer voicing are chemical hardeners, sandpaper,
						steam, and a "hammer iron." The "perfect" piano tone is, in one
						sense, completely subjective (and the subject of seemingly endless
						dialogue between piano techs and other piano obsessives) and yet a
						startling similarity of tonal concept or "tonal pocket" exists
						from one high-end concert technician to another around the world.
						<br />
						Most of the recorded pianos I hear that I like (the ones that are
						not too bright and clangy) are voiced and prepared in an amazingly
						similar manner.  This is because we are all affected and
						influenced by the piano recording and performances we heard when
						we were young---our formative experiences with piano tone that
						build our tonal memory---and tonal memory is essential to becoming
						a voicing technician. <br />

						The difference between an unvoiced piano and a voiced piano is,
						literally, night and day---the voiced piano is more pleasant, more
						exciting, has many more hidden colors and voices, is much more
						subtle and complex---it's simply more fun to play.
						<br />
						Again, few piano technicians have bothered to do the work it takes
						to become a proficient voicer, but, as I talk about elsewhere on
						this site, it's worth the time and effort it takes to find a tech
						who voices, who performs complete piano service, who can make your
						piano sing and purr, whisper and shout.
