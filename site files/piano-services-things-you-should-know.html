				<div id="piano-services-Choosing-a-Tech">
					<h3>Choosing a tech</h3>
					<p>
						This is perhaps the most important decision you make in your life
						with your piano---a gifted, experienced, honest, reliable
						technician has the power to exponentially enhance the beauty of
						your instrument, your enjoyment of it, and gratitude for it. I
						can’t stress this enough.  There is usually one or two, and
						perhaps a handful (in big cities) of tuner-technicians who are
						perceived as “the guys”:*  great tuners who can also provide
						complete mechanical and voicing services; who can rebuild &
						restore, or are allied with the best rebuilder/restorer in the
						area, who can be relied on to “do the right thing,” in the right
						time, within budget, and make the piano sound and feel a whole lot
						better than it did when they came upon it. *non-gender-specific
						use of the word, as in walking into a roomful of men and women and
						saying, “How’re you guys doing?” <br /> This person will probably
						come to you through a personal referral, and they will have a busy
						practice, servicing some of the best pianos in the
						area----professional musicians, music teachers,  people with great
						grand pianos, concert venues, recording studios, families with
						kids, passionate amateurs…a largely high-end practice, especially
						if you both live in a major city. This person will likely have
						done work for the dealer in your area that is perceived as the
						“good” guy, the honest guy, the store that deals with quality
						pianos and quality service: the “mensch” dealer. <br /> This
						wizard of a piano technologist will willingly provide you with
						profuse references, but don’t waste your time---trust the person
						who referred them to you, watch them work for a few minutes, ask
						them some questions, and you’ll be thanking your lucky stars that
						you found this person, because- 
							<ul>
								<li>they will tell you and show you the truth about the condition of your piano as they find it</li>
								<li>they will be really nice, interesting as a person, and totally
									professional in their approach to your instrument. <br /></li> 
								<li>they will offer complete piano service rather than just “tuning and
									leaving.” </li>
								<li>if you trust them, your piano will sound and feel
									better than it ever has. </li>
							</ul>
						<br /> These people are relatively few
						and far between, so hold on tight and treat them with the respect
						they deserve.  They are artisans, craftsmen-and-women who have
						spent thousands of hours honing their intuitive and cerebral
						skills and are bringing you immense value for your money. They
						won’t lie to you, and you can take their recommendations to heart
						with no fear. <br /> This “wizard” pianotech will be
						expensive---one of the highest-priced in your area.  He/she will
						have a sliding scale for students and not-rich people who respect
						him/her and ask good questions; They all love to teach.

					<h3>Larry Fine/The Piano Buyer/The Piano Book</h3>
					<p>
						NOW THE PIANO BOOK HAS MORPHED, ONLINE, INTO “THE DIGITAL &
						ACOUSTIC PIANO BUYER,” AND IT’S FREE! Buy a copy of “The Piano
						Book”----please. Or go online here.  Immediately. It’s perceived
						as the consumer’s bible for a reason.  Larry is a friend of mine,
						and he’s honest and fearless as the day is long. He’s a diplomat,
						but he tells the truth, and slices through the endless layers of
						lies, BS, myths, and half-truths that cover the piano industry.
						The book is essential for every enlightened piano owner or
						owner-to-be. It’s educational, informative, funny, honest---it’s
						rockin’.  And incredibly comprehensive, with price and quality
						updates every couple of years. This is not a paid ad, but Larry
						will have to buy me a drink the next time I see him.
					</p>		
				</div>
				<div id="piano-services-Personal-Referral">
					<h3>Personal Referral</h3>
					<p>
						A crucial key for finding people to work on your piano, and, in my
						opinion for finding anybody you pay to help you in your life. I
						would no more pick a doctor or a lawyer or a plumber or a car
						mechanic out of the phone book or a flyer than I would fly to the
						moon. Which means never, ever. 
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="piano-services-Get-what-you-pay-for">
					<h3>You get what you pay for</h3>
					<p>
						An absolute truism with regard to pianos and their service---there
						are no “great pianos for cheap,” and there are no great pianotechs
						for cheap. Period. <br /> Mercedes cost more than Fords because
						they’re better cars. Way, way better. Better materials, better
						design, better quality control, higher standards of manufacture.
						No contest. <br /> A Chinese-manufactured 5-foot grand piano that
						you buy for $7500 at Costco or your local Piano Warehouse or Piano
						Discounts or whatever, is going to be, however long it lasts, a
						PSO,* a POS,** or both.  Useless. Until I tell you it's different,
						which is coming in a few years. (g?) *Piano-Shaped Object**Piece
						Of S**t The reason a Steingraeber grand under 6 feet costs $85,000
						is because it’s a custom-designed, hand-built-by-artisans
						instrument that sounds and feels incredibly good…better than the
						rest.  It’s worth every penny to the right person. It’s a world
						away from more commercially inspired and produced pianos, as are
						many other hand-built instruments---Steinway (certainly the
						Hamburg pianos; American Steinways are a special case;)
						Bosendorfer, Fazioli, Shigeru Kawai, Feurich, and Yamaha CF series
						pianos, to name some that I love and respect.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div id="piano-services-There-are-no-stupid-questions">
					<h3>There are no stupid questions</h3>
					<p>
						Good piano artisans LOVE questions; don’t be afraid to ask any
						piano question that comes up. As a hero of mine, Roger Jolley,
						says, “Triple A, baby.” That means Always An Apprentice. 
						Buddhists call it the student’s mind. You never, ever stop
						learning about pianos. If a piano technician tells you he or she
						knows all there is about something, it’s a big red flag. 
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="piano-services-The-Golden-Rule">
					<h3>The Golden Rule</h3>
					<p>
						Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. This is the
						basis and inspiration for my business; respect and honesty are
						what I want and what I give. This maxim/guide/ context/mission
						statement is the simplest thing; I would venture to guess that
						it’s understood by nearly everyone, all 6 or 7 billion of us, but
						it’s apparently a supreme challenge for us to actually live that
						way. I’ve chosen to try, and I’ve decided I’ll work, live and hang
						out as much as possible with people that are trying to live the
						Golden Rule as well. For me, it’s not based on philosophy, or
						religion, or dogma of any sort---it’s common sense, brilliantly
						simple, and feels good.
				</p>
				</div>
				<div id="piano-services-Trust-your-own-ears">
					<h3>Trust your own ears</h3>
					<p>
						I could say this a thousand times and it wouldn’t be enough. There
						are many things that conspire to create a belief that we can’t
						really hear, or that we need some kind of backup to prove that we
						hear and perceive what we think we hear and perceive. <br />
						Something I’ve heard hundreds of times from good, sincere people: 
						“Oh, I can’t hear like you guys can; my ears aren’t that good….”
						That, or some variant of it. <br /> I always say---always---that
						that’s ridiculous, that they can hear as well as I can…and then I
						show them how they can hear very subtle nuances of tone and pitch;
						I describe a change I make very clearly, and ask them if they can
						hear what I describe.  In most instances, the light that comes
						into their faces as they actually hear what they hear, as they
						realize, in some small way, that the belief their ears are not
						capable of fine musical/tonal perception is just that, a belief,
						and not a reality, makes my day.

				<div id="piano-services-Fall-in-Love">
					<h3>Fall in Love</h3>
					<p>
						Is this going away?
					</p>		
				</div>
				<div id="piano-services-Psycho-Acoustic-Illusion">
					<h3>Psycho-Acoustic Illusion</h3>
					<p>
						One of my favorite phrases. The perfect example of a
						psycho-acoustic illusion:  I was working in a piano store in Los
						Angeles, where I live.  The manager, a good friend of mine, asks
						me to “just tune that [Yamaha] C7 in the back; it was prepped last
						month, and a player’s coming in to check it out later today.” I
						tune the piano, nothing else, no action regulation, no voicing,
						and 2 hours later, the manager comes back, plays the piano (he’s a
						real good player) and says, “Wow.  This feels so much better to
						play.  What’d ya do to it?” I smile big, and say, “I just tuned
						it.” He says, “Yeah, but it feels different.” I say “Hey! It’s a
						psycho-acoustic illusion: your ears were so happy they fooled your
						hands into thinking the piano was easier and better to play.” <br
						/> Another great example: if you ever have occasion to play a
						grand piano that’s on a dolly, or easy to roll, check out what
						happens as you play a passage with the lid open toward the nearest
						wall; then stand up, move the piano 2 or 3 feet closer to the
						wall, and see how your perception of tone and touch alters. Move
						it closer still, and feel and hear what happens. Amazing. Whenever
						I’ve done this, as I get nearer the wall, the piano becomes
						noticeably “softer” and “stiffer.” <br /> The biggest lesson from
						these examples is this: the same piano will sound radically
						different in different rooms and spaces, and a great piano
						technician can significantly change your perception of how your
						piano sounds and feels.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="piano-services-Inter-Industry-Relationships">
					<h3>Inter Industry Relationships</h3>
					<p>
						Andersen’s Law:  good dealers and manufacturers know how to work
						WITH great piano technicians, and base their reputation and
						success on partnering with them, listening to them, and trusting
						them. In my opinion, manufacturers are realizing, now more than
						ever, how strategic partnerships/collaborations with respected,
						successful technicians can enhance and expand their business.
						These manufacturers have realized an important point:  technicians
						are the people in our industry most intimately connected with, and
						trusted by, the piano-buying public; in essence, the technician
						controls or heavily influences the buyer’s decisions, much more so
						than advertising or occasional dealer visits. <br /> Dealers, with
						a few bright exceptions, are far behind this curve; most still
						insist on and/or settle for an uneasy, untrustful, adversarial
						relationship with piano technicians; In my opinion, this is
						foolish, short-sighted, no fun, and damaging to the industry. <br
						/> Piano technicians, on the other hand, are not blameless victims
						in this; the arrogant, misinformed, unethical ones create havoc
						for the rest of us, and the "rest of us," honorable and sincere
						craftspeople, can be weak and self-deprecating when the situation
						requires us to stand up, push back, and demand higher
						compensation, a trust-based relationship, clearer and more precise
						communication, and quality preparation for all pianos.

				<div id="piano-services-The-Piano-Technicians-Guild">
					<h3>The Piano Technicians Guild</h3>
					<p>
						This is an organization I proudly belong to and offers the best
						continuing education programs for piano technology that exist in
						the world.  Many of the best, most successful technicians are
						involved, teaching members of the PTG. Some are not; it’s a solely
						personal choice. I have personally made tremendous friendships and
						have had joyous and powerful learning experiences at the
						conferences and seminars sponsored by the PTG.  I recommend the
						organization highly.
