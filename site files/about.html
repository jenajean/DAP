						David Andersen Pianos is a business operated on the fundamental
						premise of the Golden Rule. We are dedicated craftspeople, and if
						a client can trust us they will receive tremendous value for their
						money.  For us, practical experience always supplants belief---we
						invite you to come and play the pianos we have on hand for sale,
						or pianos we maintain or have rebuilt, to see what a startling
						difference intuitive talent, high standards, and professional
						dedication can make in the way a piano sounds and feels. <br />
						Our services are certainly not for everyone; we are near the top
						of the cost range, and we’re picky about the clients we serve.  As
						a result, our client base of five hundred or so are a collection
						of some of the best players and nicest people in L.A.----wonderful
						families, nice churches, many music teachers and music students,
						professional players, serious amateurs, wealthy piano lovers, film
						and TV composers, performance venues and recording studios. <br />
						There are a handful of truly gifted piano technicians/rebuilders
						in our part of the country, and we are friends and/or fans of most
						of them.  In our business, collegiality and information-sharing
						between technicians and rebuilders is a huge component of success,
						and we are always open to learning from our brother and sister
						piano techs, grateful that we are secure enough to admit we don’t
						know everything, and that we need help from our colleagues and
						mentors. <br /> Click on our bios for an introduction to me and
						the talented men (and woman) who make it possible to offer these
						beautiful pianos for sale and to excel in the high-level
						restorative and maintenance work we do day in and day out.
