						<h2>About Our Team of Artisans</h2>
						<p>
							David Andersen Pianos is a business operated on the fundamental
							premise of the Golden Rule. We are dedicated craftspeople, and if
							a client can trust us they will receive tremendous value for their
							money.  For us, practical experience always supplants belief---we
							invite you to come and play the pianos we have on hand for sale,
							or pianos we maintain or have rebuilt, to see what a startling
							difference intuitive talent, high standards, and professional
							dedication can make in the way a piano sounds and feels.
	
							<br />Our services are certainly not for everyone; we are near the
							top of the cost range, and we’re picky about the clients we serve.
							 As a result, our client base of five hundred or so are a
							collection of some of the best players and nicest people in
							L.A.----wonderful families, nice churches, many music teachers and
							music students, professional players, serious amateurs, wealthy
							piano lovers, film and TV composers, performance venues and
							recording studios.
	
							<br />There are a handful of truly gifted piano
							technicians/rebuilders in our part of the country, and we are
							friends and/or fans of most of them.  In our business,
							collegiality and information-sharing between technicians and
							rebuilders is a huge component of success, and we are always open
							to learning from our brother and sister piano techs, grateful that
							we are secure enough to admit we don’t know everything, and that
							we need help from our colleagues and mentors.
	
							<br />Click on our bios for an introduction to me and the talented
							men (and woman) who make it possible to offer these beautiful
							pianos for sale and to excel in the high-level restorative and
							maintenance work we do day in and day out.

						<h3>David Andersen</h3>
						<p>
							DAVID ANDERSEN has been a professional musician, recording artist, and piano
							technician/consultant for  nearly four decades.  He has been involved in the restoration
							and maintenance of hundreds of Steinway and Mason & Hamlin pianos during that time.  
							Beginning in 1975 he apprenticed for two and a half years under Jack Cofer in Atlanta,
							Georgia; during the 1980s he studied at Steinway facilities both in New York and London.
							<br /> After moving to Southern California in 1981, David worked extensively with Sherman
							Clay, the Steinway dealer in most of California at that time, both as a concert/new piano
							preparation technician and as a quality control consultant/piano prep manager for Asian
							piano companies affiliated with Sherman Clay. <br /> He took on Steve Bellieu as an
							apprentice in 1991, and the rebuilding/restorative part of the business soon accelerated
							and expanded.  In the '90's, David began tuning for film composers and selected
							performance venues and recording studios, still his pleasure and specialty.  In late 1999
							he began a 6-year association with David Abell Fine Pianos, the landmark Southern
							California piano store, preparing & maintaining new Fazioli, Bosendorfer, Yamaha, and
							Schimmel grand pianos. <br /> He opened his own boutique piano sales showroom, the
							Atelier, in late 2005. He sells quality instruments at all price ranges, rents pianos for
							performances and recording, and presents intimate outdoor concerts and indoor salons with
							some of the world's finest pianists. <br /> Andersen continues to teach various aspects of
							his craft at Piano Technician's Guild conferences on the local, regional, national and
							international level.  He has held one-day seminars in New York City, Boston, Phoenix,
							Chicago, Calgary, Baltimore, and Albuquerque, teaching the finer, more subtle aspects of
							tuning, voicing, regulation, artisanal rebuilding, and diagnostics. His classes always
							examine how a technician is being as well as what he/she is doing.  He taught eight full
							class periods at the 2012 national PTG convention. <br /> Some of the classes Andersen has
							taught in the last four years: ---“The Ultimate Tool: using the brilliance of your body in
							high-end piano work” ---“Follow the Fourths, Luke: a radically simple approach to Aural
							Tuning” ---“The Art & Esthetics of Voicing” ---“ Whole-Tone, Open-String Tuning:  Advanced
							Listening Skills” ---“Custom, Artist-centered Restoration: the Real Story” <br /> David
							has two grown children and just recently become a grandfather; he lives in Los Angeles,
							California, with his wife and partner, the sculptor Tanya Ragir.

							"In 1991 I was presented with an opportunity to learn how to tune
							pianos and take over David Andersen’s piano service practice.  I
							doubted my ability to be able to master this unbelievable skill
							but David assured me that I was well on my way.  Knowing that it
							was going to take a while to become proficient, my own piano
							having been detuned and tuned many times, I bought some pianos to
							take apart and restore.  I also joined the Piano Technicians Guild
							at that time.  I became completely enchanted with the piano,
							particularly Steinways, and have spent these many years
							passionately devoted to making them function at the highest and
							most musical level.  I’m glad David never left his practice as
							this allowed me to find my true piano calling: restoration of
							vintage instruments, and action performance modifications on
							pianos of any vintage, sometimes brand-new. <br /> A number of
							years ago, David Stanwood (famous piano technician, based in
							Martha’s Vineyard) began teaching his techniques for "action
							balancing" at Piano Technician's Guild conventions.  I was
							completely fascinated with this area; there was not much known or
							published about this, and I was already concerned with the
							inconsistency of piano touch, even within the same makes and
							models of pianos.  Some of this information was obviously known by
							the original manufacturers' engineers, but never passed on to the
							factory workers, and became “lost” through the following decades.
							However, Mr. Stanwood also created a completely new metric for
							looking at piano action geometry and touchweight. It is
							revolutionary because it is based on weight (what the pianist
							feels) rather than geometric distance ratios, which are difficult
							to measure because they are constantly changing throughout the
							keystroke.  He also created a language and applied it to his
							system, which allows like-minded piano technicians from all over
							the world to “compare notes.”  For instance, “My client is used to
							playing a 5.5 action ratio with medium weight hammers.” <br /> My
							actions have a high degree of consistency from note to note, which
							is not attained by even the best manufacturers.  It is simply not
							practical for them to do so.  This allows the pianist to play
							better, faster and more accurately.  When your body is not trying
							to anticipate differences in geometry, compounded by differences
							in mass, from note to note, it allows the hand to relax more.  One
							of our pianos was on display at a convention and a pianist stated,
							“I can 'tear off' passages on your piano that I can’t on most
							others”.  One of the “secrets” to this level of consistency is
							controlling the weight of the hammers.  In our pianos, every
							single hammer has a target weight, unique to that specific action,
							which is maintained to within 1/10 of a gram."

							“Your courage to take on such a project, [your] creativity, sense of
							style, and refusal to settle for anything other than perfection are
							the reason your peers…and I refer to you as a true artist.” Marc D.
							Widelock, a recent client, after receiving his custom
							"riptide"-finished piano. <br /> This is one of many satisfied
							customers that have turned to Phenoyd Ezra to have their piano
							lovingly refinished. <br /> Classic Woods is a second-generation
							company, first started in the '60's, then re-established with Phenoyd
							at the helm in 1997, in Van Nuys, California. Phenoyd Ezra picked up
							what he refers to as an “old-world craftsmanship” from his father,
							learning what could be referred to as a guild-hall, or “closed” trade,
							known by only a few, growing up in a company owned by his father. <br
							/> Classic Woods is known throughout the Western United States for its
							tradition of excellence. With a consistent output of custom-quality
							work for two generations, we provide expert piano refinishing in all
							conceivable styles and color ranges; one of our secrets is taking the
							time to properly evaluate and prepare all of our pianos before
							refinishing. 	 Our standards are constantly rising, and our clients
							are secure in the knowledge they're receiving true value.
