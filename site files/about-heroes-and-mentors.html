					<h3>Jack Coffer</h3>
					<p>
						In late 1974, in Atlanta, Georgia, I was trying to figure out what
						I was going to do other than play 250 rock and roll dates a year
						on the road, living a less-than-optimum lifestyle, if you take my
						meaning.  My wife had a child on the way, and I wasn't going to be
						an absentee parent; that wasn't an option for me, even though I
						dearly loved music and had been a successful full-time player for
						many years. <br /> I had always had this thing in the back of my
						mind that I could tune pianos if I ever needed something else to
						do; I always loved the piano, laying underneath our family grand
						(a Mehlin & Sons 6'2", a good piano, the same quality for the time
						it was manufactured---1926---as a Yamaha C series piano would be
						today)  as my mother would play---everything from Bach to Errol
						Garner transcriptions to show tunes. Lying underneath, I was
						enveloped, immersed, in the massive, echo-ey sound. <br /> I
						called some piano stores and one rebuilding shop out of the
						Atlanta phone book: nothing. No openings, nobody looking for an
						apprentice, no interest.  Zip.  The next day, I called one more
						rebuilding shop, and the guy I talked to referred me to a piano
						tuning class that was being offered through a little city college
						deep in the heart of downtown Atlanta.  I signed up. <br /> In a
						dingy classroom on a rainy evening, Jack Coffer strode in the
						room. He was tall, a bit stooped, wiry and sharp-faced. He went to
						an old upright piano with the front off, sat down, and started in,
						explaining and showing the basics of aural piano tuning.  I was
						transfixed, and stayed after class.  Jack and I hit it off, big
						time. <br />

						After several weeks, amazingly, I had embodied the basics of
						tuning, and could tune a piano reasonably well---and I loved it; I
						loved solving the puzzle of the temperament, pulling in unisons,
						listening in an almost hyperfocused way, loved the whole thing.
						Jack was smart, funny, no-nonsense.  He stressed relaxing.  He
						told me I had talent, that my body knew how to do this; I just
						needed to pay attention and get better.  I trusted him and I got a
						lot better really fast. <br /> Within a month I was working
						full-time at the dealer Jack did work for (Cecil White & Sons
						Pianos) and I stayed there, working with him, soaking everything
						up, for 2 years.  He was my first teacher, and gave me a lot of
						habits and approaches, most good, some not so good.  I will always
						be grateful to him for recognizing and supporting my gift for
						pianos; he was a hard-charging, rough-edged, kind-hearted man.

					<h3>Virgil Smith</h3>
					<p>
						Certainly one of the best-known piano technicians in the United
						States, he was a piano technician and music teacher in the Chicago
						area for 6 decades. He was the foremost proponent of what he
						called "natural, whole-tone aural tuning." I use a tuning method
						which is founded on and supported by his method; you could say
						it's very, very similar to his system. Virgil championed what he
						called complete piano service for many years, and I am an acolyte
						of his in the sense that I follow, almost to the letter based on
						my 30 years' experience, the protocols he employs (and has written
						about in various articles and pamphlets over the years, in the
						clearest, simplest, most elegant language) to keep a piano in the
						best condition with minimal service after the initial
						comprehensive setup. <br /> This man was truly a hero of mine:
						smart, funny, kind-hearted, rational, a great teacher, one of the
						best tuners in the world, and he worked well into his nineties. 
						Really precise, concert-level piano tuning is a lifelong learning
						process, and Virgil allowed me to perceive the beauty of my own
						work and inspired me to get better and better, to never be
						satisfied with my work. I'm forever grateful to him for this. 
						Thank you, Virgil. <br /> ***Virgil Smith passed away in October
						of 2010; the Chicago Tribune said this: <a

					<h3>Richard Davenport</h3>
					<p>
						A titan in our profession, I've had the privilege of being close
						to his work for more than two decades.  Playing a Steinway "B" he
						rebuilt in 1986 literally changed my life.  I had been preparing
						and setting up new Steinways for the local Los Angeles dealer,
						Sherman Clay, since 1983.  In early 1987, I walked into a store
						called Merrill's Music, in downtown Santa Monica, looking for a
						piano for a client of mine.  The "B" Richard had rebuilt was
						there, on consignment. When I played it, I was dumbfounded----it
						sounded and felt so much better than the dozens and dozens of new
						B's I'd worked on in the four years prior to this day. Wow.  I
						couldn't believe it.  Not only was the tone open, soaring,
						powerful, the action felt fantastic---light, even, responsive,
						sensual; so, so balanced. <br /> That epiphany forced me into a
						deeper understanding of the action of a piano, and into the
						realization that I had a long, long way to go as a technician. 
						Richard has been the standard by which many of us who aspire to
						the high end have judged and measured ourselves.  He has taught
						and shared his rare blend of gifts with other piano technicians
						for decades, in classes at state, regional and national PTG
						conferences; his standards and ethics are impeccable.  He is one
						of the very, very few in the world who are capable of the highest
						levels of concert and recording work AND the highest levels of
						rebuilding work---a true "Renaissance man" of pianos. <br />
						Davenport is currently in private practice in Los Angeles, and is
						affiliated with Renner, maker of action parts, and Fazioli, maker
						of the world's most expensive pianos.

					<h3>Norman Neblett</h3>
					<p>
						One of Richard Davenport's main mentors, "tuner to the stars," he
						maintained many of the crucial performance pianos in L.A. through the
						'60's, '70's, and 80's.  One of the founders of what is now the Piano
						Technician's Guild, Norman has been honored with the highest award the
						PTG can bestow:  the Golden Hammer Award.  He was warm, cranky,
						generous, amazingly attractive to women of all ages, and a fountain of
						piano knowledge. It has been a particular privelege of mine that I got
						to know him personally before he died, after having sat in brilliant
						classes and seminars of his over the years.

					<h3>Randy Morton and Mick Farnell</h3>
					<p>
						These guys are the principals of Pacific Piano Supply, a local
						supply house here in southern California, and they have been my
						friends and mentors and occasional collaborators for years. I've
						learned a lot from both of them---they are unselfish and generous
						with their time and expertise, and they're simply honest, steady,
						trustworthy, good-hearted men who give our business a good name. 
						I'm proud to be their colleague.

				<div id="about-heroes-and-mentors-Bill-Garlick">
					<h3>Bill Garlick</h3>
					<p>
						One of the founders of perhaps the best school of piano technology
						in North America, the North Bennett Street School, a recognized
						expert regarding 18th and 19th century instruments, and director
						of technical services for Steinway & Sons from 1981 until 1986.  I
						met him at a 2-week-long seminar at the Steinway factory in 1984,
						and it was a revelation.  I learned as much or more in the 2 weeks
						I spent with him than in the previous 10 years combined.  He is an
						excellent teacher and storyteller, and he captured my attention in
						a profound way.

				<div id="about-heroes-and-mentors-Michael-Spreeman">
					<h3>Michael Spreeman</h3>
					<p>
						This incredibly complex, brilliant, rough, demanding, beautifully
						open-hearted and honest man heads a team of artisans in making, in
						my opinion, the finest one-off, from-scratch, custom-made pianos
						in the world. Full stop. <br /> If you haven’t seen or heard a
						Ravenscroft 7-or-9-foot piano, it’s hard to fully comprehend the
						power and clarity, and the physical beauty, of these instruments. 
						They’re made one at a time, with the utmost attention to every
						detail in every realm.  Stevie Wonder asked Michael, after playing
						a 7-foot Model 225, jokingly, “Did you make this piano just for
						me?” <br /> Spreeman is generous with his time and energy, always
						teaching other piano technologists at the local, regional,
						national, and global levels, either formally or privately. He’s a
						successful and loving husband and father, with a wide circle of
						people all over the world who love and support him. He is a force
						for good in this world, for art, for beauty, for consciousness. I
						am proud to call him my friend, confidant, teacher and mentor. <br
						/> And:  he’s funny as hell, and brings out the funny in me: a
						great  and good friend.

				<div id="about-heroes-and-mentors-David-Stanwood">
					<h3>David Stanwood</h3>
					<p>
						If there is one person that has revolutionized the way piano
						designers, engineers, tuners, technicians, and players have dealt
						with and perceived Spielart---a beautiful word that only exists in
						German, meaning “the entire feeling/perception of both tone and
						touch when the piano is played”---it is David Stanwood. <br /> His
						Equation of Balance was first revealed and started having profound
						effects on action rebuilding 20 years ago. Since then, the
						Stanwood protocols for achieving ideal touchweight in a piano
						action have been discussed, debated, fought over, universally
						accepted, and now are part of the DNA of piano building AND
						rebuilding around the world. <br /> The premium resource in the
						world for piano parts and supplies is Jahn Pianoteile, in Germany;
						they have officially declared Stanwood’s Precision Touch Design
						their preferred method of piano action rebuilding and performance
						enhancement. They sell the tools made specifically for the
						Stanwood method, and they are champions of his work. <br />
						Stanwood’s brilliant new invention, the Stanwood Adjustable
						Leverage Action, or SALA, is the first true retrofit game-changer
						in the piano business in decades. It allows the pianist to
						customize the touch of a piano instantly, with a few turns of two
						knobs; the left hand and the right hand are independently
						adjustable, and there is no change of regulation specifications at
						all, so the secure feeling of  the player stays throughout an
						astonishing range of  “lightness to heaviness” or “less resistance
						to more resistance.” <br /> One concert pianist and legendary
						teacher called it “ a completely new and different way of
						expressing emotion when I play different things. It’s brilliant.
						Profoundly brilliant.” (Click on the blue SALA above to find out
						more…) <br /> I have the honor & privilege to be partners with Mr.
						Stanwood in a company called SALApianos, Inc.  We have located
						distributor/installers around the globe, and are actively involved
						in selling the SALA device. <br /> David is a brilliant, warm,
						quirky, deeply ethical and honest man, and a fine business
						partner. We have fun and do what we love….

					<h3>David Abell</h3>
					<p>
						I thought I had a special relationship with David Abell, who many
						people have called the template for what a successful piano seller
						should be.  When he died, in February of 2006, I suddenly
						discovered he had the same kind of intimate, fatherly, “working”
						relationship, as an honored mentor, with dozens, maybe hundreds of
						people. He has been my conscience in this business for 25 years;
						so much of what I have achieved has been as a result of wanting to
						do the right thing in David Abell’s eyes.  He was a hero in the
						truest sense of the word. <br /> As a practical example of the
						Golden Rule personified, I’ve never met better.  His death created
						a tremendous void in the piano world.    "[I want to thank]
						someone who is not here this evening, but is responsible for
						showing me this path. He showed a young music major the amazing
						transformation a piano goes through in the hands of a
						“professional piano technician”. Time and time again, he showed me
						the joys a musician experienced playing a beautifully prepared
						instrument. He showed me the value of educating the novice about
						the workings of a piano and why they deserved better than
						grandma's upright spinet grand that "never needed tuning." He
						taught me selling quality and service was sometimes harder but it
						was the right thing to do. <br /> He ignited a passion by example.
						Although not a technician himself, he supported PTG and hired some
						of our best & brightest to work on his pianos. His pianos were
						always prepared for the pianist---beginner and professional alike.
						His reputation for service among musicians is legendary. If the
						piano came from him there was no need for concern. He had the
						highest of standards and was abundant in praise if the instrument
						had merit and constructively critical if it didn't. He was
						especially tough on the manufacturers he loved and cared so much
						about; he tried to get them to produce the best pianos possible.
						<br /> Over the years, he has helped raise millions of dollars to
						support young musicians by way of scholarships and instrument
						loans, often with the help of his friends at Yamaha and
						Bosendorfer. He felt giving back to the community was of the
						utmost importance. David Abell was an advocate for the
						technicians, the pianists and the piano makers, but, in the end,
						it was for his love of music that he worked so tirelessly. 
In the
						end, everything we do is for the music.
			<br />Kayoko
						Forrest, RPT in a speech at the 					California
						State PTG Conference, February 11, 				          2006,
						the night David Abell died <br /> 
"Thank you, Kay, for sharing
						this.  We would like to have been there to hear it in person.  I
						was particularly touched by your very meaningful and appropriate
						comments about David Abell and the tremendous impact his life and
						example have had on so many.  It was just very special.  I’ve
						always believed if his standard of excellence, ideals, and
						philosophy could be broadly adopted and practiced in our industry,
						it would be quite a different and better business in nearly every
						way."                               <br /> Lloyd Meyer, CEO<br />
						                               Renner USA <br /> "Many of you
						already know---David Abell passed on.  In between the tears I shed
						because I will miss the man, I feel the joy that David brought me
						for so many years.  He planted himself in my soul and it is there
						that he will blossom until forever." <br />  John Clayton,
						bassist/arranger<br /> Clayton/Hamilton Big Band<br /> Oscar
